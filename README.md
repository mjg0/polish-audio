# polish-audio

`polish-audio` polishes and concatenates audio and video voice recordings. It's a thin wrapper over [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) and [SoX](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/), choosing sane defaults for the human voice but allowing access to all the power that SoX provides. To install and use, put `polish-audio` somewhere in your `PATH` and run `polish-audio --help`.
